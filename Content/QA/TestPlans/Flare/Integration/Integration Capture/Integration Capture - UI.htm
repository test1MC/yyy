        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li><b>Edit with MadCap Capture:</b>Launches MadCap Capture with the selected image for editing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Image Viewer</h4>
        <p>To open the Image Viewer double- click an image in the Content Explorer</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/TestPlans/Flare/Integration Capture/ImageViewer.png" style="width: 582px;height: 570px;mc-thumbnail: popup;" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The local toolbar will contain one button ("Edit this file with MadCap Capture") if it has not been created or saved in Capture or two buttons, with the second being "Regenerate Captured image".</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Edit this file with MadCap Capture:</b> Will open the file in MadCap capture.</li>
            <li><b>Regenerate Captured image: </b> Used to update image to its Capture state. (test: Edit Captured image in another program such as MS Paint, save, the click this button. The image should revert back to its Capture state and remove the changes made outside Capture)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Conditions and Variables</h3>
        <p>Like Mimic, conditions and variables from a Flare project linked to the image will be available for use in Capture. However, in Capture, the project is already linked to the image, so all variables and conditions will be available in Capture when editing an image that is in a Flare project in Capture.</p>
