        <h3>Baseline</h3>
        <p><span class="bold">10979	</span>Problem: File List does not offer a means of limiting list to Echo files.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">10980	</span>Problem: Attempting to insert an audio link when Echo is not installed/registered generates an incomplete UI.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">10981	</span>Problem: The current UI which pops up when you try to use Echo from Flare when Echo is installed but not registered needs to be completed.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">10987	</span>Problem: MadCap Echo Audio link dialog is mislabelled.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">11051	</span>Problem: Audio Links and Movie Links within a topic don't preview very nicely.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">11066	</span>Problem: Need a browse button when adding an echo file</p>
        <p><span class="bold">11169	</span>Problem: When generating flare with Echo sounds inerted, the compiler refers to Webvoice</p>
        <p><span class="bold">11233</span>	Problem: Compile stops if you do not have echo installed</p>
        <p><span class="bold">11378	</span>Problem: When inserting a recorded audio link, it doesn't default to Audio folder and it doesn't work unless you put it there.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">11830	</span>Problem: Unless text and icon are selected. Edit Audio link creates a new audio link and icon is added to project.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">11837	</span>If audio clip is saved to a directory other than the default Audio folder the file path retains the Resources/Audio path.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">27912	</span>Need a compiler warning (as exists for PDF and others) for DITA if you try to generate DITA output with a link to an Echo file.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">33556	</span>Compiling a flare movie with an echo sound, on a machine (vista) with no .mp3 codec, will give an error hidden in the compiler spam and not on the error tab</p>
