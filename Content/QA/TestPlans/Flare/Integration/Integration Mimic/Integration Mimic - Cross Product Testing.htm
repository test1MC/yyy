        <h3>How to link your Mimic Movie or Project to a Flare Project:</h3>
        <h4>Stand Alone Movie</h4>
        <p>In Mimic:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Open the movie</li>
            <li>!Movie | Movie Properties.</li>
            <li>The Movie Properties dialog opens.</li>
            <li>Select the Project tab.</li>
            <li>Click the Browse button.</li>
            <li>In the dialog that opens, select and double-click the Flare project to which you want to link.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Project</h4>
        <p>In Mimic:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Open the project.</li>
            <li>The Project Editor opens.</li>
            <li>Select the Project Link tab.</li>
            <li>Click the Browse button.</li>
            <li>In the dialog that opens, select and double-click the Flare project to which you want to link.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">Using Shared Variable and Conditions only works one way. They must all be created within Flare to use them in Mimic. Variables and Condition Tags created in Mimic are not shared with your Flare Project, however they will output correctly.</p>
        <p class="note">From the Help: Let's say that you have created a MadCap project containing 5 movies, and you have incorporated this Mimic project into a Flare Help project. You want to use the variables from that Flare project. Therefore, you open the Project Editor in Mimic and create a variable link to the Flare project (using the Project Link tab). All of the variables from that Flare project automatically become available for you to use in your MadCap Mimic project (i.e., they are project link variables). Suppose that you want to use a variable called "ProductName" in your MadCap Mimic movies. The definition that you have provided for that variable name in Flare is "OurSoftware Version 1." So in various movie frames in your MadCap Mimic project, you might create bubble callouts and select the ProductName variable to insert within them. The callouts now display any text you may have typed, plus the definition of the variable (e.g., "Welcome to OurSoftware Version 1"). Now let's say that it is a year later and your company has created another version of the software, called "OurSoftware Version 2." You need to change this name everywhere in your Flare project, as well as everywhere it has been used in your MadCap Mimic movies. If you had not used a variable, you would need to manually find and replace the old name with the new name. Fortunately, you used a variable, so all you need to do is change the definition in one place. If you had created the variable within MadCap Mimic, you would edit the definition in Mimic's Project Editor (or in the Movie Properties dialog). However, in this example, you used a variable from your Flare project. Therefore, you would modify the variable definition from within the Flare project. After you do so, the definition is changed everywhere that the variable was inserted (including within the callouts in your movies).</p>
