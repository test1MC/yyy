        <p class="bold">Description:</p>
        <p>When you move window panes, explorers, or editors around in the Flare interface, the configuration (or "layout") of the workspace is changed. You can do several things with layouts, including the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Save You can save different layouts of the interface, in case you want to use them for different purposes.</li>
            <li>Auto-save You can automatically save the layout of the workspace when you exit Flare. The next time you launch Flare, that same layout will be displayed.</li>
            <li>Select You can quickly change the configuration of your workspace by selecting a window layout that you have saved previously.</li>
            <li>Reset You can return the workspace configuration to the original layout that you saw when you first installed and launched Flare.</li>
            <li>Reload You can return the workspace to the saved configuration of the layout. In other words, if you are working in a particular layout and have opened different interface elements or moved interface elements around, you can select this option to go back to the saved configuration.</li>
            <li>Lock You can freeze a window layout so that the window panes and editors cannot be moved floated or docked to different areas of the interface.</li>
            <li>Delete You can open the Manage Window Layouts dialog, which lets you select or delete an existing layout.</li>
        </ul>
