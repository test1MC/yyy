        <p class="bold">Description:</p>
        <p>Flare has expanded its team collaboration support to include mappings to external resources.</p>
        <p>A new External Resources window pane lets you select and maintain groups of external files that you want to share among Flare projects. The paths of these resource folders are written to the registry so they will be available for all your Flare projects.</p>
        <p>External Resources can be virtually any local or network folder to which you have access. From the External Resources window pane, you can easily copy files contained in those external folders into a project (i.e., a copy of the file is added to your Flare project). Additionally, you have the option to keep the local project file synchronized with the external resource file through mappings.</p>
        <p>File mappings are independent of External Resources, but will often work hand-in-hand. File mappings let you tie a project file to some external file. The external file does not need to be contained in a designated External Resource folder to maintain its mapping, but it often will. File mappings allow users to keep the local copy of a file synchronized with an external copy of the file.</p>
        <p>The external resources feature is ideal for shared files that you expect to change over time (e.g., logo images, PDFs, style sheets), as opposed to, say, a template file that is simply copied into your project and changed only in that project.</p>
