        <h2>Track Changes - Baseline</h2>
        <h3>Baseline</h3>
        <p><span class="bold">39239</span>If a marker (like a keyword, concept, bookmark, etc) is deleted with Track Changes, and then the topic is viewed with Show Markers disabled, the Deleted balloon appears to point to nothing.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39323</span>The MadCap:changes attribute gets carried from one paragraph to the next when pressing [Enter] at the end of a changed paragraph</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39328</span>If you select and delete the contents of 2 p's that were changed in track changes mode and you are now editing with track changes mode turned off, you get an empty marker "&lt;MadCap:change&gt;&lt;/MadCap:change&gt;</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39329</span>With track changes on, if you create a span around a selection, the track changes balloon pointer is shorter than it should be</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39331</span>In a snippet, rejecting all changes leaves empty html tags.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39333</span>Failed to run command Track Changes.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39339</span>Track Changes button appears active for files for which it will not track changes.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39340</span>If you insert an object such as a movie with track changes on, it shows the object block bar as the change. If you place the insertion point before the object and hit enter a few times to add some p's, they are not counted as a change and therefore no MadCap:changes tag is written</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39345</span>&lt;MadCap:change&gt; tags are being inserted in track changes mode when adding a space at the end of a paragraph.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39347</span>Adding any content (text, help controls, proxies, bookmarks, pictures) while in track changes to an exisitng &lt;p&gt;, then rejecting the change leaves empty &lt;p&gt; tags and does not revert back to the original state.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39351</span>If you type text in track changes mode on an existing p (not created in track changes) and then delete it after in track changes mode, u get empty p tag markers without the original non-breaking space</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39378</span>If your insertion point is on the first tag of a topic like an h tag and you have a track change in a preceding p, hitting previous change should either do nothing or offer a warning saying there are no more track changes instead of moving to the change that is after the insertion point.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39389</span>The way we write the time for track changes is inconsistent with annotations.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39396</span>Changing the font of a selection using the format toolbar and using the font properties button on the format toolbar yield 2 different results in track changes</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39399</span>Tracked unbind changes do not display the name of the unbound tag in some instances (if the tag has a "MadCap" namespace?).</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39403</span>Clicking on the track change balloon when you add a p and text highlights the p tag correctly but does not highlight the block bar until you click it a second time. Kinda nitpicky but usability wise the user might be looking for the block bar highlighted and not realize the p is still highlighted</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39415</span>When you have a tab open that isn't a topic, accept change and reject change buttons on the review toolbar should be greyed out</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39449</span>Deleting an added word, all while in Track Changes, will result in a single letter with the Strikethrough on it</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39467</span>New span tags' span bars (and some other inline tags) do not display in red when added in track changes mode.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39473</span>With track changes on and you insert an equation, but then change that equation with track changes still on, we add a second track change called modified. Because we have remained in track changes and we are editing a change, there should be no second track change created.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39518</span>When in track changes mode, clicking the superscript/subscript buttons writes the change to the tag, but does not display the text as such in WYSIWYG</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39547</span>When the page layout is set to 2 columns the bubbles for track changes in the left column are unable to be seen or accessed to accept or reject a change.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39548</span>In print layoutmode with 2 columns, rejecting a change in the second column then attempting to undo the rejection causes a failed to run comman undo. Then Flare is in a bad state.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39558</span>With track changes on, text does not move to the previous page when pressing backspace before the first word of the second page.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39559</span>In print layout mode, rejecting a change in the second page attempting to undo the rejection causes a failed to run comman undo. Then Flare is in a bad state.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39573</span>In track changes mode, editing a picture through the edit picture right click drop-down does not track changes for print size changes</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39584</span>Track Changes coloring does not carry over from one body frame to another in page layouts with multiple body frames.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">39764</span>Failed to run command previous</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39798</span>If you have removed something in a p with track changes on and manually select the content in the p and click delete or backspace, you get a failed to run command</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39803</span>with track changes on, entering a p within a removed change and then rejecting the change leaves the added p behind</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39817</span>Rejecting changes made to table cells results in empty tags.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">40192</span>If you have a pre-existing bullet in a list, turn track changes on, type something and then reject the change, the WYSIWYG incorrectly renders the bullet and subsequent text (fine in output)</p>
