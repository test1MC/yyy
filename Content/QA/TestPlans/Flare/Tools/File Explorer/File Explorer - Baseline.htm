		<h2>File Explorer - Baseline</h2>
		<h3>Baseline</h3>
		<p><span class="bold">38420	</span>Flare crashes if I try to open a folder I do not have access to via the File Explorer.</p>
		<p><span class="bold">41341	</span>Cannot access \\dc2\ on ricks new fancy navigation bar</p>
		<p><span class="bold">41362 </span>Sorting in the File Explorer is by string rather than numeric value.</p>
		<p><span class="bold">41489	</span>When saving a file out from Flare, I can't navigate anywhere using the address bar (to navigate to its lower directories), because the Save button is active.  When I type dc2, for example, and press [Enter], the dialog closes and I assume Flare tries to save the topic directly to dc2</p>
		<p><span class="bold">42240	</span>Our new 'open dialog' hotness does not display shortcuts to folders</p>
		<p><b>49444 </b> When adding a resource (image) to your project, if you navigate for your resource a particular way, when you ultimately select your file, and click Open to add the file, it won't work.  You have to click in the file path before Open will work.</p>
