        <p class="bold">Description:</p>
        <p>When you first start typing content in a topic, a popup will display below your text as you type. This is IntelliSense, which is a technology that analyzes text as you type and compares it to other text that you have already typed in the project. It allows you to quickly select existing content from a popup similar text that you have already entered previously.</p>

                <p> Starting with this version, IntelliSense is being replaced by Auto Suggestion. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Like IntelliSense, Auto Suggestion lets you choose existing content as you type. However, Auto Suggestion is different from IntelliSense in the following ways.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Focused suggestions Rather than basing the suggestions on all of the text throughout your entire project, Auto Suggestion gives you more control over the text that you see in the popup when you type. In addition to several common system suggestions (e.g., date, time) that are already provided, you can add your own words and phrases to an auto suggestions list. That way, instead of being overwhelmed with too many suggestions every time you begin typing text, you only see suggestions that you are likely to use.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Snippets In addition to system content, text from your auto suggestions list, and variables, Flare recognizes when you are typing content that matches existing snippets in your project. This makes it a very fast and convenient way to single-source your content.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enable/disable suggestions from specific files With IntelliSense, you could enable or disable the entire feature if you did not want to use it. You can also do this with Auto Suggestion. However, you also have the ability to enable or disable the suggestions from particular files (i.e., those from a specific auto suggestions word list, those from specific variable sets), in case you want to use some types of suggestions but not others. You can also enable or disable suggestions from all snippets.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Auto suggestion maximum number and minimum character length Not only can you control which types of files are included in the Auto Suggestion popup, but you can also specify the maximum number of suggestions shown in the popup (from 1 to 25). In addition, you can specify the minimum number of characters that must be typed before the popup opens with suggestions (from 3 to 12).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
