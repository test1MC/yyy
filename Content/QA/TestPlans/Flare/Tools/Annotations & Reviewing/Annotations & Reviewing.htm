        <p class="bold">Bug Base Product Area: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Annotations/Reviewing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Description:</p>
        <p>Annotations allow you (or another user) to apply "comments" to selected content within a topic (or snippet, etc). Annotations will most commonly be inserted in Contributor when a Flare topic is sent for review. However, the functionality to insert an annotation is present in Flare to allow the Flare author to add annotations for their own benefit. </p>
        <p>Reviewing allows an author to send a topic to another person, who may then open the topic in Contributor. From there, the reviewer may add annotations (and possibly edit content) and send the topic back to the Flare or Blaze author. Annotations added by a reviewer can be accepted or rejected when a topic is returned from a reviewer.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        <p class="bold">&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Dependencies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contributor (for the review process)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Testing Resources (Copy all files to local Machine before importing):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>None</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Notes and things to add to the testing resources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add File Properties for ALL File types</li>
            <li>add bug 41730</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Annotations</p>
        <p>Annotations are now edited directly in the XML Editor. Therefore, the Edit Annotations and Annotations window panes have been removed. See Inserting Annotations and Editing Annotations.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In addition, annotations now use the same user initials that are part of the new track changes feature. You can change the initials (and user name) from Tools&gt;Options&gt;Review tab. See Changing Your User Name and Initials.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Changes Tracked</p>
        <p class="bold" style="font-weight: normal;">Tracked Changes are covered in this text plan: <a href="../Track Changes/Track Changes.htm">Track Changes</a></p>
        <p class="note">Note: Because of the addition of the track changes feature, when you send a topic for review, there is no longer an option to allow reviewers to edit the topic or not. However, you can always lock certain portions of a topic so that they cannot be edited. See Locking Elements.</p>
