        <h1>Output XHTML Book</h1>
        <p class="bold">Bug Base Product Area: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Output: XHTML Book</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Description:</p>
        <p>XHTML is a browser-based output type that consolidates project content in an XML file. It can be viewed online or printed. The output appears as one long book, even if the project consists of hundreds of topics. You can view and print the XHTML output.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>XHTML is a good choice if you need an "intermediary" format for your large, custom, enterprise level proprietary systems. You can easily transform Flare-authored content into your own system. By creating the single file output, you can feed it into your own parser/transform and convert all of the Flare content to your internal formats. This is part of the flexibility that allows Flare to be integrated into just about any tool chain or work flow. If you do not have a situation like that, you may find one of the other formats to be a more suitable option for you.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>XHTML consists of a collection of XHTML files that you can print or distribute to users. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A file with an .htm extension. This is the XHTML file that contains the consolidated topic content from your project.</li>
            <li>A file with an .mcbook extension. This file is used to display the chapters in the MadCap Book Viewer.</li>
            <li>A Resources folder with various ancillary files, such as style sheets and images.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If you want to make XHTML output accessible for others, you need to include all of the files in the output mentioned in this list. Otherwise, when they view the output, certain elements (e.g., images) might be missing from the pages.</p>
