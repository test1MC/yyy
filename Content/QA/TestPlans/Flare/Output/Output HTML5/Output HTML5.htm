        <h1>Output HTML5 (WebHelp 2.0)</h1>
        <p class="bold">Bug Base Product Area: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Output: HTML5</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Description:</p>
        <p>Also referred to as "WebHelp 2.0" in Flare, HTML5 is an online format that is the next generation of WebHelp. It is similar to the regular WebHelp format; however, whereas the original WebHelp format works with HTML4, WebHelp 2.0 supports the HTML5 specification developed by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG—http://whatwg.org) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C—http://w3.org). Therefore, the HTML5 format results in better markup and offers additional features not found in the other WebHelp outputs.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Following are some of the key features of the HTML5 format.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>WebHelp features This format lets you take advantage of features and benefits available with the regular WebHelp output type.</li>
            <li>Frameless output Pages in HTML5 output do not use frameset or frame tags, like they do in regular WebHelp output. This means that, behind the scenes, HTML5 output can be said to be "frameless," even though the user still sees distinct areas that display content, navigation, and toolbars.</li>
            <li>Specific page addresses With the regular WebHelp output, you can only give others one URL path, which opens the starting page for the output. With HTML5 output, you can point end users to a specific page in the output by giving them the exact URL path.</li>
            <li>Search engine optimization (SEO) When you generate HTML5 output, Flare automatically generates a site map, which makes it easier for web crawlers (i.e., spiders or bots) to find your output. Therefore, the entire output is indexed and search engine results are improved.</li>
            <li>Modern looking When you build HTML5 output, you will notice that it has a more modern look, compared with the older WebHelp formats.</li>
            <li>Search with context If end users perform a search in your output, they will see context next to each result, rather than terms only.</li>
            <li>Smoother dynamic effects Features such as drop-down text, expanding text, and popups have a smoother appearance when they are activated.</li>
            <li>Improved accessibility The move from HTML4 to HTML5 includes new elements (such as nav and article), which provide additional help to screen readers.</li>
            <li>Server-based output You can create HTML5 output in its regular state, or you can select an option in the Publishing tab of the Target Editor to enable server-based functionality. This allows you to accomplish the same results as WebHelp Plus output—-searching of non-XHTML content, faster server-side search, and automatic runtime merging.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
