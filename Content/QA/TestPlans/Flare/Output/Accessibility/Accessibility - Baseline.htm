        <h2>Accessibility- Baseline  <![CDATA[ ]]></h2>
        <h3>Baseline</h3>
        <p><span class="bold">6215</span> Better Narrator support - A lot of links say "Hidden"</p>
        <p><span class="bold">6218</span> Screen reader reads "Text Field"  Should read what the text field is for "Index input field","Search input field", "Quick Search input field", etc, e.g., i.e.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">6233</span> Toolbar doesn’t have &lt;Tab&gt; access</p>
        <p><span class="bold">6235</span> There are no way to get to accordions that are not displayed</p>
        <p><span class="bold">18797</span>Title attribute for Frames.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">20751</span>Iframes in WebHelp's Navigation frame need 'title' attribute for Criteron-508 compliance</p>
        <p><span class="bold">20752</span> When searching for a term in the index, you cannot easily select the term searched for using the keyboard. Tab moves to the first item in the index.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">20942</span>They need to get rid of the index frame from the output file *entirely*, not just hidden away like it is now</p>
        <p><span class="bold">21592</span> For 508 compliance, labels are needed for the search and index boxes.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">25216</span> Tabbing to Ghost frames that are not included in the output.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">28971</span> X-Refs should automatically populate the ALT and Title fields of the links in WebHelp for 508 compliance.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">30222</span> Cannot easily navigate from Index search field to results without using mouse</p>
        <p><span class="bold">32112</span>The sort-order for search results in WebHelp output is not keyboard accessible</p>
        <p><span class="bold">37355</span> 508 compliance for multimedia</p>
        <p><span class="bold">38806</span> Add onkeypress to onclick function</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39117</span> Currently the delete selected favorites buttons in the favorites pane on webhelp output both have tooltips saying "delete selected favorites" We need to change the default ones to say what type of favorite, whether the search one or topic one.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">39198</span> Incorrect compiler warning when the caption is misplaced in the table tag.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">40648</span> If a table has a caption and you change the number of header rows, the 508 warning warns that there is no caption</p>
        <p><span class="bold">40737</span> Opening the index pane on web output should have the insertion point placed in the typing box (currently there is seemingly no focus)</p>
        <p><span class="bold">40782</span>In pdf output, adobe displays the alt text of images as a screen tip, but does not for qr codes or equations that have alt text set</p>
        <p><span class="bold">41307</span> The human language of the frameset and of the individual frames is not specified.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">41309</span> Active Images. The toolbar icons are not announced by JAWS; They are &lt;div&gt; tags with title attributes, but they need alt attributes.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">41311</span> No Info Dependant on Presentation Layers. The links in the top frame are not available as text or as images when css are turned off or replaced.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">41312</span>Semantic Markup / Link Text. At the top of the TOC frame, JAWS reads “Void(0)” as link text for an &lt;a href …&gt; element that has no link text, but includes "void(0)" as part of the href attribute.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">41313</span> Hidden Elements. Some iFrames that are not part of the offered functionality ('Glossary', 'Topic Comments', 'Browse Sequences', 'Recent Comments') are announced by JAWS. These are all hidden visually and they should be hidden for screen reader users too.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">41314</span> Hidden Elements. The iFrames that are available for viewing ('Index', 'Search', 'Favorites', and 'Contents') are announced when they are supposed to be closed.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">41315</span> Images. The book icons open and close to reveal the state of the submenu, but this information is not reflected in the alt-text for the book icon.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">41318</span> Keyboard. The index search does not work with the keyboard. When you leave the input field (tab) you are back at the top of index list, instead of on the topic found.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">41321</span>Form Labels. The INDEX input field does not have a label associated with it.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">41322</span> Active images / No info in presentation layers. The magnifying glass image to the right of the Search button is nowhere to be found by JAWS; It is a &lt;div&gt; with a background image and a title “add search string to favorites.” It also disappears when css if off or replaced.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">41325</span>Active images. The red "Delete Selected Favorites" X’s for are not seen by JAWS or those using custom CSS. They are background images and are not identified (see #5.1).</p>
        <p><span class="bold">41327</span> Form Labels. The checkboxes are not labeled.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">41329</span>Semantic Markup / In-Page Navigation. "Favorite Searches" and "Favorite Topics" are not marked as headings.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">41902</span> PDF Tagging is not Tagging Links with "Link"</p>
        <p><span class="bold">42070</span> If we have a table nested within a table and the outside table has no header element, but the inner one does, we do not throw a compiler warning for it</p>
        <p><span class="bold">42246</span> Cross-References are not tagged as links in PDF output.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">43210</span> JAWS no longer reads toolbar buttons correctly in IE 9. Instead of saying "topics favorite button" or "expand all button" it now only reads "button"</p>
