        <h2>Accessibility - Notes</h2>
        <h3>General Notes (Remove Bugs When Fixed)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>input type="button" does not need a label</p>
                <p>input type="image" does not need a label but does need alt text</p>
            </li>
            <li>Accessibility - Output is an ongoing list of things that may be overlooked while testing</li>
            <li>There is an analyzer report for accessibility but that should be covered in the analyzer test plans.</li>
            <li>There is a filter on the right side of the bug base thats called 'Improved 508 Support' (its next to the fogbugz number).</li>
            <li>
                <p>Alt text of images and links are not written to the output for word and frame bug 42043</p>
            </li>
            <li>There are some issues with the screen reader working in Chrome.</li>
            <li>JAWS&#160;requires a lot of setup to get it to do what you want.</li>
            <li>PDF's will only be tagged on output when the option 'Generate Tagged PDF' under PDF&#160;options in the target.</li>
            <li>Use Inspect Element when trying verify things like checking Alt text on elements in the output. Inspect Element is now in the context menus for current versions of all three major browsers (IE 11 (new for IE), FF 27, and Chrome 33)</li>
            <li>Make sure to use the Tab key and arrow keys to navigate output while JAWS&#160;is running</li>
            <li>Make sure to test hitting Enter key and Spacebar key while using JAWS to see if they open and close things such as popups. (Currently there are issues in HTML5 that are bugged)</li>
            <li>With v10, we added the ability to HTML5 to be more 508 compliant</li>
            <li>With v10, we added a transparent.gif behind the image icons for glossaries, dropdowns, expanding text, togglers and help controls, so that Alt text can be added to these nav links and so there open/close states can be heard by screen readers. The alt text can be modified in the stylesheet and the Language skin (currently...there is a bug to move the HTML5 version of that into the UI&#160;Text section of the HTML5 skin to be more consistent)</li>
            <li>In addition to that, they are now wrapped in &lt;a&gt; tags in order for user to tab to them. We ran into alot of issues where they were then inheriting from &lt;a&gt;. We cleaned that up quite a bit, but keep an eye out for anything that maybe different than v912.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Ability to add attributes to forms and frames in a UI instead of directly in the XML.</li>
            <li>Better accessibility checks like Adobe's</li>
        </ul>
