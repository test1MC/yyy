        <p class="bold">Bug Base Product Area: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Language Skins</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Description:</p>
        <p>A regular skin controls the interface that users see for online outputs. They are stored in the Skins folder of the Project Organizer. By default, the text in these skins is in English, and they are used not only for editing text but also to control the look of the skin in the output (e.g., color, navigation elements). See About Skins.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>On the other hand, a language skin can be used to display the interface in a different language for WebHelp outputs (WebHelp, WebHelp Plus, WebHelp AIR, and WebHelp Mobile). Language skins hold only text used for the output; they do not control the look of the output. To control the appearance of the output, you must use a regular skin in addition to the language skin. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In addition to strings used in the actual skin interface (button labels, button tooltips, etc), language skins also provide out-of-the-box default translations for content items which have default labels (default Help Control labels, the default cross-reference format, the default breadcrumbs text, etc.). Any feature added to Flare in the future which allows for a string (label, tooltip, alt text, etc.) to be set in the CSS should also be added to the language skins. But note, any string set in the CSS&#160;will always be used over the language skin. The language skin is only used to replace default strings. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>HTML5 uses the "UI&#160;Text" section of the HTML5 Skin file for most of its localized strings. However, HTML5 still leverages language skins for the purposes of providing default translations for those content items which have labels. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p> Eclipse Help does not use a Skin file at all. However, it will still need to leverage language skins for the purpose of providing default translations for content items which have labels.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Print outputs do not use Skin files either. However, print output types will also leverage language skins for the purpose of providing default translations for cross-reference formats ("See {title} on page {pagenum}," "See below,"&#160;etc.).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Language skins are not part of a Flare project. They are saved in the user's AppData\Roaming folder, therefore they can be used by all projects created by that user. If you want to share a Language skin, you must send the Language skin to other users who may be working in the same project.</p>
