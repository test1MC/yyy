        <h1>Output WebHelp AIR</h1>
        <p class="bold">Bug Base Product Area: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Output: Air</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Description:</p>
        <p>WebHelp AIR is a Web-based Help format that is identical to the regular WebHelp output in most ways. However, WebHelp AIR uses direct integration with Adobe AIR, which is designed to bring Web-related content to a desktop environment by taking Web files and incorporating them into a single file to be opened locally, rather than from a server.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The WebHelp AIR output that you generate consists of a single file with an .air extension, which you distribute to users. When users access this file, they are taken through an installation process, and as a result an executable file with an .exe extension is created on their local drive and saved in their C:\Program Files directory. In other words, the output becomes its own application. The output will be displayed in the application window that is part of the AIR installation.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>WebHelp AIR is a good choice if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You want all of the features and benefits available with WebHelp.</li>
            <li>You want to be able to distribute a single file, as opposed to multiple output files.</li>
            <li>You want users to store and open the output locally, rather than from a server, such as a website.</li>
            <li>You want to create output that has just one file.</li>
            <li>You want users to be able to install the file not only in Windows, but in a Macintosh and Linux environment as well.</li>
        </ul>
