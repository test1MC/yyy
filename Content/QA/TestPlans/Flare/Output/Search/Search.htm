        <p>When your end users need to find specific information in your project, the three most common methods they use are: the search feature, a table of contents (TOC), and an index.</p>
        <p>You can add the search feature to any of your online output targets. When users want to find information about a specific subject, they enter key words in the Search field. A search engine looks through every topic in your project to find the term(s) entered by the user. When it finds the terms, it presents the user with a list of topics to open. Search results are ranked, not listed alphabetically.</p>
        <p>The search feature is good because it is very thorough. However, it also might return several topics that contain the search terms but are not really relevant for the user's needs. That is why creating an index is also important.</p>
