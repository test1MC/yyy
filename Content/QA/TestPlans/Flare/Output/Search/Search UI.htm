        <h1>Search UI</h1>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">Following are the basic steps for adding the search feature. <b>Note:</b>This is feature is supported in all online outputs. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Enable the search feature in the skin by using the skin editor <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/TestPlans/Flare/Search/search enabled - skin editor.png" alt="" title="" /></li>
            <li>Associate the skin with search enabled with the target that is going to be generated. </li>
            <li>(Optional) Create a search filter that will link search terms to concepts. Concepts are simply keyword markers that you insert into topics that have some kind of relationship with each other. They are also used for inserting concept links into topics</li>
            <li>(Optional) Create a style sheet so when the search term appears the term's that are found are highlighted in the topics. The background for each term found in a topic is highlighted in a different color. In Flare you can create styles for this purpose and change not only the color background, but other settings as well (e.g., font style, text decoration). </li>
            <li>(Optional) You can include a particular topic in the generated output but exclude it from any search that users perform.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Include stop words in your search filter so that Flare has a list of words behind the scenes so that it omits certain common words (such as "an" and "the") </li>
        </ol>
