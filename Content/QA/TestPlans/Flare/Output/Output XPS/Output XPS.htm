        <h1>Output XPS</h1>
        <p class="bold">Bug Base Product Area: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Output: Native XPS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Description:</p>
        <p>Microsoft's XML Paper Specification (XPS) is a document format with a markup language that is a subset of XAML for Windows Presentation Foundation. XPS is an alternative to Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF). You can generate XPS output from your project directly (as long as you have Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 installed on your computer, which is a free download from microsoft.com). Alternatively, you can generate XPS output while simultaneously building Word 2007 output (by installing a free add-in download from Microsoft). The output appears as one long book, even if the project consists of hundreds of topics. After you generate the output directly (without going through another application, such as Word), you can view and print the output.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>XPS is a good choice if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You want to create output in a smaller file size than you would get from Adobe PDF.</li>
            <li>You want users to be able to view the book online, as well as print it.</li>
            <li>You want to take advantage of the benefits provided by XPS, such as better print quality, easy file sharing, and enhanced security.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>XPS output consists of a collection of XPS files that you can print or distribute to users. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A file with an .xps extension. This is the file that contains the consolidated topic content from your project. This is the main file and the only one that is essential. This is the file that you would provide to a printer or distribute to end users.</li>
            <li>A Resources folder with various ancillary files, such as style sheets and images.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If you want users to download an XPS document from a server (e.g., from a website), you need to enable the server to do this by registering the MIME types and file extensions. See Registering MIME Types and File Extensions for XPS Output.</p>
