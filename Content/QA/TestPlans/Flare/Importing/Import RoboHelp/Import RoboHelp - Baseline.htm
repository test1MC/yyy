        <h2>Import RoboHelp - Baseline</h2>
        <h3>The Imported Project</h3>
        <h4>Verifying a successful import</h4>
        <p>After importing a RoboHelp project you should compare the Flare project to the original RoboHelp Project </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Compare the original project with the new one </li>
            <li>Compare the original output with the new projects output</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Here is a list of things to check that import correctly (Make your own RH projects if necessary)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Topics (Specifically the content and formatting of the content)</li>
            <li>Lists<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Bulleted</li><li>Numbered</li><li>Images</li></ul></li>

            <li>Headers</li>
            <li>Footers</li>
            <li>Styles (if you selected the correct option above)</li>
            <li>Folder structure is maintained</li>
            <li>All topics are converted correctly to XML</li>
            <li>Merged Projects (slaves) are imported as well</li>
            <li>Publishing destinations</li>
            <li>Shortcuts</li>
