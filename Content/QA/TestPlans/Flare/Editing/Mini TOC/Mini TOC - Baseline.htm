        <h2>Mini TOC - Baseline   <![CDATA[ ]]></h2>
        <h3>Baseline</h3>
        <p><span class="bold">18801	</span>Currently there is nothing set and it causes errors in Word generation and the TOCs don’t work in Weboutputs.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">18849	</span>MiniTOC local properties are not being saved. The Stylesheet is over riding the property all the time.&#160;</p>
        <p><span class="bold">18868	</span>Mini TOC proxy is only picking up topics in its immediate directory and not topics below them in WebHelp and HTML Help based outputs.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">18961	</span>MiniTOC - If I use a class for one, we write the style to the topic and we shouldn’t.&#160;</p>
        <p><span class="bold">19078	</span>MiniTOC is using wrong styles which causes them to start off indented in xHTML outputs.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">20571 </span>When the primary target is PDF, XPS or XHTML Help, when you preview a topic which contains a mini-TOC proxy, the mini-TOC does not appear in the preview.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">22349	</span>If a topic in the TOC uses a bookmark link, and that topic contains a mini-TOC proxy, the proxy will not display.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">23163	</span>Need a way to control the color of MiniTOC Proxy links in Webhelp/HTML Help</p>
        <p><span class="bold">23959&#160;</span>MiniTOC Link colors are reset to black - This is because MadCap.css has it set as black and that's the second one in the cascading order.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">24144 </span>Mini-Toc Proxy appears with different formats</p>
        <p><span class="bold">44007 </span>Indentation not working for Web output mini-TOC</p>
