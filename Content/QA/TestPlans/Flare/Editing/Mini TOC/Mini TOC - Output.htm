        <p class="note">There is currently different behavior for native PDF, XPS and XHTML&#160;outputs when compared to Word and Frame (See bug numbers 32269 and 32270). In Word and Frame, if you have a second mini TOC&#160;within the range of headings covered by a previous mini TOC, the second mini TOC&#160;"cuts off" to prior mini TOC. For example, I&#160;have a mini TOC&#160;that occurs under an h1 and is set to display headings 2-9. I&#160;have another mini TOC that occurs after an h4 that falls inside the range of the first mini TOC. This second mini TOC&#160;will cause the first mini TOC&#160;to stop at h4 instead of continuing to h9. Mini TOCs in PDF, XPS and XHTML&#160;outputs do not get cutoff in this way.</p>
