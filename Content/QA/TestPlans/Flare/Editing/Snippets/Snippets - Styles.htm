        <h2>Snippets - Styles</h2>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>As of Flare V6, you can't style a Snippet. Although the UI&#160;is present and styling a Snippet appears to work when you view the Snippet in the XML Editor, when output is generated, the MadCap:snippetBlock (or MadCap:snippetText)&#160;tag is dropped so styles do not affect Snippets in the output. To achieve the same affect, the current workaround is to place the Snippet inside a div tag (span tag for text snippets)&#160;and apply styles to the div (or span).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This is a known issue that has long been considered as designed. Perhaps in a future version, we will consider injecting div or span tags around styled Snippet tags on compile. Until then, this section of the test plan will serve as a space holder.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The only features which can currently be applied to a Snippet tag are Condition and Name functionality. These would typically be applied locally. Do verify that these work.</p>
