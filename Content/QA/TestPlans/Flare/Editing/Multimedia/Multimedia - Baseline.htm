        <p><span class="bold">32378</span> In the Insert Multimedia/Edit Multimedia dialogs, if the dialog is opened to the General tab long enough for the video to complete, when you then switch tabs, there is a black box rendered over the UI where the video was.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">32383</span> If you drag and drop a multimedia item into the XML Editor, the current undo/redo options are "Undo &lt;menu title&gt;" and "Redo &lt;menu title&gt;"</p>
        <p><span class="bold">32391</span> The context menu for the object tag contains many img items.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">32932</span> We do not show compile Messages when going to a target that doesn’t support Multimedia and we do not strip out the &lt;Object&gt; tags.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">33411</span> Opening swf file in Image Viewer shows a blank white screen</p>
        <p><span class="bold">33469</span> In Flare after building output and attempting to  edit a WMV2.wmv files Flare adds WMV2.wmv to the beginning of the file path thus making the path incorrect.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">33646</span> An image in a table cell appears huge in output (DotNet &amp; Web), if that table follows a multimedia link in the topic and the Target option "Generate resized copies of scaled images" is enabled.</p>
