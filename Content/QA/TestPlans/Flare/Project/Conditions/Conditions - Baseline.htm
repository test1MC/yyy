        <p><b>47040 </b>Any UI which lists Condition Tag Sets needs to include the name of any sub-folder the condition tag may be in.</p>

        <p><b>54279</b> Conditions applied to objects in BMP and TIFF image files are not applied/used during the build of online targets when the option "Generate "web-safe" images" is selected.</p>
