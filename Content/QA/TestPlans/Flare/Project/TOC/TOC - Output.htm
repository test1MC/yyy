        <h3>TOC Editor Setup for all output types</h3>
        <p>Topics must be added to the TOC&#160;file via the <span class="UI">TOC&#160;Editor</span>. For all sample screenshots provided in this test plan, I have used a *fltoc file that looks like this to demonstrate the unique behaviors of Web versus Print output types:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/TestPlans/Flare/TOC/TOC--SampleTOC.png" alt="" title="" class="left" />
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 180pt;">
            <li>All topics linked from this *.fltoc file use the headings indicated by the TOC&#160;label pictured</li>
            <li>For the Web-based output types, the TOC&#160;topic was conditioned out</li>
            <li>No advanced options were enabled (see <MadCap:xref href="#Advanced" target="" title="" alt="" class="TitleOnly">Advanced&#160;Target Options for print output</MadCap:xref> below)</li>
            <li>No mc-heading-levels were adjusted (see <MadCap:xref href="TOC - Styles.htm#Other" target="" title="" alt="" class="TitleOnly">Other relevant styles:&#160;mc-heading-level</MadCap:xref> in the "Styles" test plan)</li>
            <li>All defaults settings are used in all screenshots </li>

                <li style="margin-left: 250pt;"><span class="bold">Use TOC&#160;depth for heading levels: </span>Enable this option to use the depth of a TOC&#160;node in the <span class="UI">TOC Editor</span> to set the heading level of linked topics. This will change your heading levels in you content based on their position in the <span class="UI">TOC Editor</span>.</li>
                <li style="margin-left: 250pt;"><span class="bold">Inject headings for unlinked books in TOC: </span>Enable this option to inject a heading into the generated TOC and your content for all unlinked books that exist in the <span class="UI">TOC Editor</span>. This will make the generated TOC&#160;appear more like the TOC&#160;Editor, but it will also add headings to your content.</li>

                        <li> If this option is enabled, all outputs will strip the image from the headings completely. The image will not appear in the generated TOC&#160;nor will the image appear in the heading as it appears within the content.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>When generating DITA output, Flare's TOC source code needs to be converted to a DITAMAP. For example, the TOC&#160;used in this Test&#160;Plan should output like this:</li>
        </ul><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;</pre><pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE map PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DITA Map//EN" "map.dtd"&gt;</pre><pre>&lt;map&gt;</pre><pre xml:space="preserve">  &lt;topicref href="Content/TOC.dita" navtitle="TOC" /&gt;</pre><pre xml:space="preserve">  &lt;topicref href="Content/Heading 1.dita" navtitle="Heading 1" /&gt;</pre><pre xml:space="preserve">  &lt;topicref href="Content/Heading 2.dita" navtitle="Heading 2"&gt;</pre><pre xml:space="preserve">    &lt;topicref href="Content/Heading 3.dita" navtitle="Heading 3" /&gt;</pre><pre xml:space="preserve">    &lt;topicref href="Content/Heading 4.dita" navtitle="Heading 4" /&gt;</pre><pre xml:space="preserve">  &lt;/topicref&gt;</pre><pre>&lt;/map&gt;</pre>
