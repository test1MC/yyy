        <p class="bold">Description:</p>
        <p>There are two kinds of reports in Flare. The reports covered in this test plan are Analyzer reports that are created based on analysis scans of your project. These reports show various types of information that Analyzer captures from your project, such as broken links, topics not indexed, and more. While all reports will generate from Flare, some will only produce a numeric total ("Suggestion" reports) unless Analyzer is also installed. Reports have an .flrep extension and are stored in the Project\Reports folder of the project.</p>
        <p>Starting with V7, the items have been categorized, making it easier for you to find and select related data. In addition, each category has a "Select All" check box so that you can quickly choose all of the items in a category.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The other type of reports are error reports that you can save from error logs. These logs display when you generate a target that contains certain issues. This type of report (also referred to as a log file)&#160;uses the .mclog extension and is also stored in the Project\Reports folder. Testing for .mclog files is covered in the Output&#160;Window/Reports test plan.</p>
