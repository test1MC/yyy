        <p class="bold">Description:</p>
        <p>X-Edit, X-Edit Contribute and X-Edit Review are a three-in-one application derived from Flare’s XML WYSIWYG interface. The full version of X-Edit is designed to create single standalone documents (*.mcdoc files) much like Word or Frame. X-Edit Contribute is designed to open and edit contribution template files (*.mccot files) created from a topic in a Flare or Blaze project. X-Edit Review is designed to open review files (*.fltrev or *.bltrev) created from a topic in a Flare or Blaze project. The full version of X-Edit can be used for review or contribution purposes however much of the UI in Review and Contribution is simplified or disabled to simplify the process.
</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Bugs related to the Contribution or Review workflow should, for the most part, be written as Flare bugs unless the bug specifically deals with X-Edit's handling of the contribution or review file. Since many of the bugs with X-Edit will also be bugs with Flare, this test plan will house the X-Edit specific bugs. Where appropriate test the baseline bugs in Flare as well.</p>
