        <p class="bold">Description:</p>
        <p>This window displays a list of all files where you have glossary term links inserted into content, but those glossary terms have not been defined. This might occur, for example, if you have created a new term in a glossary and then inserted that term into a topic as a glossary term link. Later, you remove that term from the glossary. Therefore, you now have a glossary term link in a topic, but the term no longer exists in the glossary. You can quickly rename or unbind multiple glossary term link occurrences in a single batch. Make sure a check mark is next to the rows you want to affect, and click the "Rename" or "Unbind" button. You can double-click a row to open the topic or other file in the Analyzer interface. You can also select the row and click "Send to Flare" or "Send to Blaze" to open the file in the appropriate application.</p>
