        <p><span class="bold">15390</span> - There are texts in a bubble.  If the bubble has color gradient set, the background of the text won't have the same background as the bubble…  (it won't have the gradient)</p>
        <p><span class="bold">19109</span> - When creating a mouse cursor in a movie after recording a movie, there is no way to keep the mouse cursor in the same place from frame to frame, especially when creating cursor animation.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">19809</span> - When modify font and point size in Callout, add to Palatte and then use from Palette, text changes to Tahoma 8pt.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">26099</span> - Per the meeting, a shape group that has a time span set manually, will overwrite all time spans of objects inside it</p>
        <p><span class="bold">26206</span> - Text is wrapping when a word is bolded</p>
        <p><span class="bold">27028</span> - Feature suggestion: Add an option to show objects that are invisible, that is, objects with no background color and no line width.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">30605</span> - Error on images that are to large, when looking at rectangle properties</p>
