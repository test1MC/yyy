        <h3>UI Test Cases</h3>
        <h4>Workflows</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>!File | Open<ul><li>Select the newer version of the movie</li><li>Select the older version of the movie.</li></ul></li>
            <li>The frame editor will open up, along with a frames pane and properties pane. The frames for each movie are shown side-by-side in the Frames window pane. The frames for the old movie are displayed on the left, and the frames for the new movie are shown on the right.After your old and new movies are loaded, you can make sure that the frames for each are aligned properly. When you perform the transfer, the properties and objects from the frame on the left (old movie) will be copied to whatever frame is immediately to its right (new movie).</li>
            <li>
                <p>After aligning frames, you can immediately transfer the properties. However, before you do that, you might want to examine all of the properties that MovieSync has identified, just in case there are some that you do not want to transfer. As you select each aligned frame, the Properties window pane lists all of the properties for each movie. It also displays any differences between the old and new movies by showing those properties in red. You can select or deselect any properties to be copied.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Once you are satisfied that the old and new movies are aligned properly and all of the correct properties for each frame are selected, you can transfer (copy) properties and objects from the old movie to the new movie. You can do this one frame at a time, or you can click a button to transfer properties and objects for all frames at the same time.</li>
            <li>
                <p>After transferring properties successfully from the old movie to the new movie, you can save your changes.</p>
