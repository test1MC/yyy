You can double-click the button to open the Button Properties dialog, which lets you assign an action to a button (e.g., go to next frame) that occurs when a user clicks the button in the final movie. You can also use the appropriate tabs in that dialog (Mouse Hover and Mouse Pressed) to change the look of the button when the mouse hovers over it or presses it.<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li><p><img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/TestPlans/Mimic/Properties/Button/UI--Button Toolbar.png" /><b>(New Button Mode):</b> Lets you create a button.</p></li><li><p><img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/TestPlans/Mimic/Properties/Rollover/UI--Icon Rollover Caption Toolbar.png" /><b>(Rollover Caption Mode):</b> Lets you create a rollover caption.

When the user does this, a caption with text that you provide appears on the frame.</p></li><li><p><img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/TestPlans/Mimic/Properties/Boxes/UI--Typing Boxes Toolbar.png" /><b>(Typing Box Mode):</b> Lets you create an animated typing box. When you record a movie, Mimic captures any typing actions that you perform on screen. This typing is therefore animated in the movie output. In other words, each letter of the content is typed as the user watches it. Not only are these animated text boxes added automatically when you record movies, but you can also add them manually when you edit the movie.</p></li><li><p><img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/TestPlans/Mimic/Properties/Boxes/UI--Input Boxes Toolbar.png" /><b>(Input Box Mode):</b> Lets you create an input box. If you want the user to enter text at a certain frame in the movie, you can accomplish this by adding an input box. You can then enter the exact content that you want the user to type. You can also format the text, as well as specify captions and actions based on the user's input.</p></li><li><p><img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/TestPlans/Mimic/Properties/Boxes/UI--Input Success Caption Toolbar.png" /><b>(Input Success Caption Mode):</b> Lets you create an input success caption. After you add an input box to a frame, you can add a success caption to accompany it. This is a message that displays to users after they complete the input box successfully.</p></li><li><p><img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/TestPlans/Mimic/Properties/Boxes/UI--Input Failure Caption Toolbar.png" /><b>(Input Failure Caption Mode):</b> Lets you create an input failure caption. After you add an input box to a frame, you can add a failure caption to accompany it. This is a message that displays to users if they fail to complete the input box successfully within the specified number of attempts.</p></li><li><p><img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/TestPlans/Mimic/Properties/Boxes/UI--Input Hint Caption Toolbar.png" /><b>(Input Hint Caption Mode):</b> Lets you create an input hint caption.

Each of these modes lets you create a square or rectangle shape by clicking in the frame and dragging in any direction. When you release the cursor, the shape is created. The effect that you see depends on which mode you selected.<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li><img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/TestPlans/Mimic/Toolbar Icons/Shade Effect.png" /><b>(Shade Effect):</b> The area inside the shape is clear, while the area outside the shape is shaded. The shade color is based on the color selected in the Appearance tab of the Frame Properties dialog. From that dialog, you can change the color, as well as the darkness of the shading. If you want to create this effect with other closed-off shapes (e.g., oval, polygon), first draw the shape in the frame, then enable the shade effect from the Image Effects tab in the properties dialog for that object.</li><li><p><img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/TestPlans/Mimic/Toolbar Icons/Gray Scale Effect.png" /><b>(Gray Scale Effect):</b> The area inside the shape is displayed in its original color, while the area outside the shape is displayed in gray. If you want to create this effect with other closed-off shapes (e.g., oval, polygon), first draw the shape in the image, then enable the gray scale effect from the Image Effects tab in the properties dialog for that object.</p></li><li><p><img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/TestPlans/Mimic/Toolbar Icons/Blur Effect Effect.png" /><b>(Blur Effect:)</b> The area inside the shape is clear, while the area outside the shape is blurred. You can change the amount of the blurriness from the Frame Properties dialog. If you want to create this effect with other closed-off shapes (e.g., oval, polygon), first draw the shape in the frame, then enable the blur effect from the Image Effects tab in the properties dialog for that object.</p></li><li><p><img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/TestPlans/Mimic/Toolbar Icons/Zoom Effect.png" /><b>(Zoom Effect):</b> The area inside the original rectangle is enlarged and displayed in another rectangle that is larger and seemingly closer to the user (a three-dimensional effect). You can adjust the zoom settings from the properties dialog for that object.</p></li></ul></li>

After you select this button, you can click anywhere in the frame to identify the starting point for the shape. When you move the cursor, a straight line segment is drawn. If you click the left mouse button, it signifies the end of that line segment and the start of another line segment. When you move the cursor, another straight line segment is drawn. When you double-click, a final line segment joins your starting and ending points, thus closing off the shape.</p>

After you select this button, you can click anywhere in the frame to identify the starting point for the line. When you move the cursor, a straight line segment is drawn. If you click the left mouse button, it signifies the end of that line segment and the start of another line segment. When you move the cursor, another straight line segment is drawn.
