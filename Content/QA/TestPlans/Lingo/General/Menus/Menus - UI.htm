        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li><b>Minimize to System Tray:</b> By default, when you minimize Lingo, a shortcut button on the main part of the taskbar lets you reopen the application. However, you can select this check box if you want to minimize Lingo to the system tray instead. With this option selected, a shortcut icon is placed in the system tray (i.e., notification area) of the taskbar when Lingo is minimized. You can click on this icon and select Restore to reopen the application.</li>
            <li><b>Auto-Reload Documents:</b> 	Select this check box if you want Lingo to reload documents automatically. In other words, if you have topics or editor pages open and then close the project, this option ensures that those same documents are reopened the next time you open the project.</li>
            <li><b>Auto-Save Documents:</b> Select this check box if you want Lingo to periodically auto-save any open files. You can specify the number of minutes that should elapse between each auto-save.</li>
            <li><b>Open files with these extensions…:</b> 	If you want certain types of files to open automatically in the Document Dock pane, enter those file extensions in this field, separating each one with a semi-colon (e.g., xml;text;asp). The Document Dock pane is an empty window pane that is docked by default on the left side of the Lingo interface. You can use this pane to display any type of document in that window pane, instead of displaying the document in its current location.</li>
            <li><b>Close others when opening new document:</b> 	You can have multiple files of all types open in the interface at the same. By default, when you open a new file, other documents that are already open remain open. However, you can change this behavior so that files already open in the interface are automatically closed when you open a new document.</li>
            <li><b>You can use any of the following auto-close options:</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>Close others:</b> This option automatically closes all other open documents.</li>
            <li><b>Close others:</b> with no changes This option automatically closes all other open documents that do not have unsaved changes. If you have files open where changes have been made but not saved, those files will remain open until you save and close them.</li>
            <li><b>Close others:</b> with same extension This option automatically closes all other open documents that share the same file extension.</li>
            <li><b>Close others:</b> with same extension and no changes This option is the same as the previous option, except that files with unsaved changes will not automatically be closed. Those files remain open until you save and close them.</li>
            <li><b>Reset "Show Once" Dialogs:</b>There are some dialogs in Lingo that open just once to give you a message or warning when something changes or you switch modes. These dialogs have a check box labeled "Show this dialog." If you deselect that checkbox, you will not see the dialog again. However, you can use this reset feature to display that dialog (and all other "Show Once" dialogs) again the next time.</li>

        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li><b>Retrieve suggestions with a minimum match of:</b> 	Enter a percentage in the field. Only translations with a rank greater than or equal to the specified percentage will be displayed as suggestions in the interface.<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>EXAMPLE: Let's say that you set this percentage to 50%. When using translation suggestions, you might have one translation in your database that matches the current string exactly (100%), another translation that matches it 75%, and a third translation that matches it only 30%. In this case, only the first two translations will be available for you to select in the interface.</li></ul></li>
            <li><b>Fill-in fuzzy matches of at least:</b> 	Enter the percentage at which you can insert matching translations automatically. By default, this percentage is set at 100%, meaning you can use automatic inserts only when text strings match existing translations exactly. However, you can reduce this percentage if you wish. Any matching translation that falls below that specified percentage is considered "fuzzy," because it does not match the string closely enough to warrant an automatic insert.<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li><b>EXAMPLE:</b> Let's say that you open a topic to translate the text in it. You press ALT+S to open the Suggestions window pane. In that pane, a few matching translations from your translation memory database are shown. Perhaps two of the translations match segments exactly (100%) and there are other partial matches that are below 100%. Perhaps one of those is a 98% match. All of the partial matches, including the one at 98%, are considered "fuzzy." When you first opened the Suggestions window pane, a message displayed. It might say something like this: "2 segments had matches of at least 100% and there were 3 other partial matches. Do you want to use the top matches automatically?" If you select Yes, the two translations that match text 100% will replace the corresponding strings in the topic automatically. If you want to use any of the partial matches, you must do so manually. Now suppose you want to be able to automatically use matching translations if they match 97% of the string text. Therefore, you set the fuzzy matching option to 97%. If you then return to the same topic and press ALT+S, this time the message will say the following: "3 segments had matches of at least 97% and there were 2 other partial matches. Do you want to use the top matches automatically?" If you select Yes, both of the 100% matches are automatically used, as is the 98% match (because it is no longer considered a "fuzzy match").</li></ul></li>
            <li><b>Automatically apply translations to the rest of the file:</b> 	Click the check box if you want to instantly apply translated strings to any duplicates within the current file. After entering the first translation of a term, the other instances of that same term will also be translated.</li>

        <p><b>Dockable:</b> 	If you select the "Dockable" option when a window pane is active, the Drag Pane area   is shown or hidden in the window pane accordingly. The Drag Pane area lets you move the window pane and dock it elsewhere in the program window.</p>
        <p><b>Auto Hide:</b> 	"Pins" the active window pane or editor to the side of the interface so that you have more room for your workspace. You can show the window pane by hovering over the thin bar on the side of the interface. If you select the "pin" button at the top-right of the window pane, the window pane returns to its previous state (no longer "pinned" to the side of the interface).</p>
        <p><b>Floating:</b> 	Converts the active window pane or editor to a "floating" window, which means it is no longer "attached" to the interface. This is a good option to use if you want to work on two topics side-by-side. If you do not want a window pane or editor to be "floating" anymore, you can right-click in the title bar and select Floating.</p>
        <p><b>Layouts:</b> 	Opens a submenu, which lets you select options for creating and selecting layouts. A layout is a particular configuration of the workspace.</p>

        <p><b>Save Window Layout:</b> As Opens the Rename Window Layout dialog, which lets you save the current interface configuration as a layout.</p>
        <p><b>Reload Window Layout:</b> If you are working in a particular layout and have opened different interface elements or moved interface elements around, you can select this option to return to the saved configuration of the layout.</p>
        <p><b>Reset Window Layout:</b> Returns the current configuration of the interface to the factory layout settings (the original layout when you first installed and launched Lingo).</p>
        <p><b>Layouts:</b> Opens the Manage Window Layouts dialog, which lets you select or delete an existing layout.</p>
        <p>Select Layout Opens a submenu that lists the layouts in your project. Select a layout to display it in the interface.</p>
        <p><b>Windows:</b> 	Opens the Manage Windows dialog, which lists the files that are currently open in your project and lets you activate (i.e., switch to), save, or close a particular file.</p>
        <p><b>Document Dock:</b> 	Opens the Document Dock pane. This is an empty window pane that is docked by default on the left side of the Lingo interface. You can use this pane to display any type of document in that window pane, instead of displaying the document in its current location.</p>
        <p>Send To Other Dock 	After you open the Document Dock pane, you can move the active document to that window pane from its current location.</p>
