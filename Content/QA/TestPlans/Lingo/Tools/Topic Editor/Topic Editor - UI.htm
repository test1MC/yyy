        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Grid mode allows you to work with the file content in text strings organized in columns, similar to the way other content (e.g., tables of contents, variables, glossaries) is displayed in the respective editors. The grid mode not only lets you translate the text in small segments, and it is also necessary to use this mode for translating hidden text strings (e.g., hyperlink screen tips, alternative image text that is used for Section 508 compliance). These hidden strings can be translated only in grid mode.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Background colors:</b> White=Not Translated; Gray=Translated/Accepted; Red=Match Exists From TM (darker the shade, higher the match percentage).</p>
        <p class="note">Although index keywords and concepts may appear in topics, they are not translated in those same files. For example, to translate all index keywords, open the Index.liindexmap file from the File List window pane.</p>

        <p>The visual mode displays two window panes. The text in the source language is shown in the left pane, and the text in the translated (or soon-to-be translated) language is shown in the right pane. The visual mode displays the file in the same way that the author edits it in Flare or Blaze, with content shown in complete headings, paragraphs, lists, and so on.</p>
        <p class="note">Note  You might notice light green or dark green rectangles in the topic with text inside. These are index and Concept keywords, which are not translated using the Topic Editor, but rather their own editors. You also might notice places in the topic where you cannot select text. This is likely a snippet or variable, which is inserted into a topic but not edited from there. Like index and Concept keywords, snippets and variables can be translated separately from topics.          <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p class="note">Note  The bars that you see to the left of content are called "structure bars." They allow you to see the exact tag structure of the file as you work.          <![CDATA[ ]]></p>

        <p class="note">As you make changes in the translation area the content in the grid area should update as well.</p>
        <p><b>Test case:</b> If the tags in the translation area match the source then you should be able to move to the previous or next segment. If they do not match the user should get an message saying the tags do not match.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The suggestion area shows matches based on segments in the translation memory. If it is an exact match it will show up at a %100 match. If it is a 'fuzzy' match such as 92% or 81% it will show up as well. This means that most of the segment matches but some of the words are different.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You can select a match in the suggestion area and the content will appear in the translation area. You can use the shortcuts of Alt+# to quickly select a suggestion overwriting the content in the translation area with the suggestion content. Alt+CTRL+# will add the content of the suggestion to the content that is in the translation area vs overwriting it.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If no translation memory is select it will say No translation memory in the suggestion area.</p>
