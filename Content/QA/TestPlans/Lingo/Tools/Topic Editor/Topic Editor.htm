        <p class="bold">Description:</p>
        <p>The editor is used to translate topics and snippets in a Flare or Blaze project, as well as master pages in a Flare project. Master pages are not used in Blaze.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li><b>Topics In Flare and Blaze projects:</b> topics are the main pieces of information that authors create. This is where most of the translation work is done in Lingo. When translating topics, you can work in the traditional grid mode, but you can also work in visual mode (which displays topics in their full context in side-by-side window panes, with the source language on one side and the target language on the other).</li>
            <li><b>Snippets:</b> A snippet is a chunk of reusable, formatted content that an author inserts in multiple locations (e.g., topics) throughout a Flare or Blaze project. You can think of it as a miniature topic inserted within a larger topic. Therefore, a snippet is also translated using the Topic Editor. When translating snippets, you can work in visual mode or grid mode.</li>
            <li><b>Master pages:</b> Authors use master pages to provide content that is repeated in many or all topics in a Flare project. You use the Topic Editor to translate master pages. In addition to text in a master page, you may sometimes see proxies, which are gray bars that serve as placeholders for generated content. You do not need to worry about translating the gray proxy bars. When translating master pages, you can work in visual mode or grid mode.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Topic Editor allows you to work in grid mode, but visual mode as well. Therefore, with visual mode, you can view the topic in the normal paragraph format, the way users will see it in the output. The editor is split into two windows, with the source language on the left and the target language on the right. This allows you to view content in its intended context and provide the translation for all of the text at once, rather than only in small segments (as you would in grid mode, which displays the text in a table format, with the source text right next to the translated text).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>There are benefits to both the visual mode and grid mode. The visual mode is useful because it allows you to translate a great deal of text at once. The grid mode not only lets you translate the text in small segments, and it is also necessary to use this mode for translating hidden text strings (e.g., hyperlink screen tips, alternative image text that is used for Section 508 compliance). These hidden strings can be translated only in grid mode.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Note: If you are working in a "difference" project, special icons display next to the areas in the left window pane (in visual mode) or next to the rows (in grid mode) where changes have been made since the last version of the project. The type of icon shown depends on the type of change that has been made. In grids, a "Difference" column also provides an indication of what was changed in the content.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Note: Instead of master pages, Blaze uses page layouts. However, this version of Lingo does not support the translation of page layouts.</p>
