        <p class="bold">Description:</p>
        <p>This window pane is used to display translation memory (TM) suggestions that match the selected content in an editor. A translation memory (TM) system is a database that consists of content in a source language next to the translated content in one or more target languages. The great benefit of a TM system is that it remembers what you have already translated in previous projects and uses it to provide suggestions for future translation work.</p>
        <p>After you translate text in a project, you can upload your work to the translation memory (TM) database. This enables Lingo to make suggestions while you translate text in the future. You can upload selected areas of content (e.g., sentences, index keywords), single files (e.g., topics, snippets), or entire projects (i.e., all content). Once the translated content is uploaded, you can quickly view and select it as you translate other content.</p>
