        <p class="bold">Description:</p>
        <p>When you create an alignment project, Lingo matches the files and aligns them by name. Although it might not be a common occurrence, there are a variety of reasons that a file from the original project might not be aligned with the same file in the translated project. The important thing is that you identify such misalignments and then correct them. You can do this by using the File Map window pane.</p>
        <p>In an alignment project, the File Map window pane is used instead of the standard File List window pane in a regular Lingo project. It groups files found in both projects by file type. For each type, you can match the files together when necessary. There are a few operations for aligning files; you can shift the selected cells up and down, or swap two selected cells. After the files are aligned, you can manually upload them to your translation memory database.</p>
