        <p><b>To edit terms via the Edit Termbase Terms Dialog, do  the following:</b>
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Double-click a segment or </li>
            <li>Right-click a segment and select properties.<ol><li>The Edit Termbase term dialog opens. The terms that you highlighted are also highlighted in the corresponding fields in this dialog.(Optional) If you want to add more detailed information about the term (e.g., source, definition, related term, context sentence, usage), click Advanced.</li></ol></li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Multi-Term selection:</b>&#160;</p>
        <p>Holding Control while highlighting words or phrases in a BoxView (particularly the Suggestions Pane in Lingo) create multi-word selections, like in Word.  Unlike Word, the subsequent selected areas have different colors, in order to indicate pairing between source and target language phrases.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Editing Termbases</b>
        </p>
        <p>You can edit the words in a termbase, which is not possible in a dictionary. Not only that, but you can also add much more detailed information about each term (e.g., source, definition, related term, context sentence, usage). That way, whenever you are using the termbase to perform translation work, you can refer to this extra information if necessary.</p>
        <p>How to edit a termbase</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Do one of the following:<ol><li>Select View&gt;Termbase. OR</li><li>In the Standard toolbar click   .<ol><li>The Termbase window pane opens.</li><li>	In the local toolbar, click Manage Termbases.</li><li>The Manage Termbases dialog opens.<ol><li>Select the termbase that you want to work with.</li><li>Click Edit.</li><li>The Termbase Editor opens.<ol><li>Select the <b><a name="Search"></a>Search</b> tab.</li><li>(Optional) You can use the filter field in the local toolbar at the top to quickly find a particular term. Simply type the term you want to find and press Enter. You can also use wildcards (asterisks) in your search.</li><li>EXAMPLE: If you want to find the term "Delete," you can enter the following: All terms that start with "Dele" will be found. Each time you type something in the filter field, it will be saved in the drop-down for future searches.</li><li>Double-click on the term that you want to edit.</li><li>The Edit Termbase Term dialog opens.<ol><li>Using the fields in this dialog, you can change the text for either the source or target language.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h4>Adding Terms to Termbases</h4>
        <p>After you add a termbase, you can add translated terms (or phrases) to it. You can do this through the Termbase window pane (without needing to have any files open for translation at the same time) or through the Suggestions window pane.</p>
