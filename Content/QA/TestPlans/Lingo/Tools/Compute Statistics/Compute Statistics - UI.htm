        <p><b>How to compute statistics:</b>
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Do one of the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select File&gt;Compute Statistics. Or..</li>
            <li>In the Project Editor, click Compute Statistics.</li>
            <li>The statistics report opens as an HTML file, showing the following information (both for the entire project, as well as for individual documents in the project):</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li style="margin-left: 150px;">Number of segments</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 150px;">Number of words</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 150px;">Number of duplicates (These are segments that occur multiple times within the project. For example, the first time a segment occurs in the project and there is no match in the translation memory for it, it is counted as "No Match." If it shows up again 20 times in other places, it is counted as a "Duplicate.")</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 150px;">Number of translated segments and words</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 150px;">Matching percentages of segments and words in translation memory (e.g., the number of segments and words that have 100% matches, those that have 85%-94% matches, those that have no matches)</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 150px;">Number of no matches (These are segments that are not translated and have no useful suggestions in the translation memory.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        <p>This toolbar is taken from Flare and has un-used UI items which should be removed at some point.</p>

            <li>Back and Forward buttons are grayed out and not used</li>
            <li>The stop button is active but there is nothing to stop</li>
            <li>The refresh button is active but it does not refresh anything nor does it compute statistics again.</li>
            <li><b>Print</b>: Allows you to print the statistics report and opens the print dialog.</li>
            <li><b>Save To</b>: Allows you to choose where you want to save this statistics report and open the save as dialog.</li>
