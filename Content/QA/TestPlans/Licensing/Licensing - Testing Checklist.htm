        <h2>Licensing - Testing Checklist</h2>
        <ul class="checkbox">
            <li>Test across all supported OS's,  32 and 64 bit versions, and Foreign versions of the OS's. (Win&#160;XP, Vista, Win 7)</li>
            <li>Make sure 66-character keys from previous application versions don't work</li>
            <li>Test using both single-app and MadPak keys, and make sure MadPak keys don't work for applications they weren't generated for</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the application should free up an activation</li>
            <li>Make sure we preserve the license key when reactivating after a deactivation. Note, this is different from activating after uninstalling/reinstalling (license key should not be preserved here)</li>
            <li>Test that we give you a warning message when trying to deactivate while offline</li>
            <li style="color: #000000;">Verify that adding time to a subscription works properly, both before and after the subscription has expired</li>
            <li>If there are 30 days or less remaining on a subscription, the user should get a warning message once per day which counts down properly</li>
            <li>Make sure all dialogs are accurate both pre-expire and post-expire, and the buy now links are to the proper SKU</li>
            <li>Make sure you are able to activate a license key behind a proxy</li>
            <li>Make sure activations work properly in a Citrix-based environment</li>
            <li style="color: #ff0000;">Make sure old but still valid flare keys work even if the current date is past the expiration date of the original security certificate</li>
