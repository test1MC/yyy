        <h2>Licensing - Baseline   </h2>
        <h3>Baseline</h3>
        <p><span class="bold">47175</span>A subscription license that is not connected to the internet will not enforce its end of life date, if the system time is pushed back.</p>
        <p><b>47340</b>flare doesn't release its floating activation key if it crashes or is force closed by the task manager</p>
        <p><b>48308</b>Going "back in time" on your machine does not change your Trial days</p>
        <p><b>48955</b>Evaluation keys (and subscription keys) are not working on  parallel machines.</p>
        <p><b>49278</b>floating license keys are not timing out properly when disconnected from the internet</p>
        <p><span class="bold">49329</span>Can still use/work in Flare even after subscription license has expired as long as I don't close the subscription expired dialog</p>
        <p><b>50835</b>flare is not preserving your license key after deactivation (note: the expected behavior for deactivation is different from activating after uninstalling/reinstalling)</p>
        <p><b>54282</b> If I deactivate Flare while I have multiple instances of Flare running, only the current instance is forced closed.  As a result, I can continue to use the other instances of Flare as long as I keep them open.</p>
