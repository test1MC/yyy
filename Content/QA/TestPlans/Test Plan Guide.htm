        <h2>Test Plan Guide</h2>
        <h3>Topics</h3>
        <h4>Test Plan Structure</h4>
        <p>All test plans should include a "landing"&#160;page. This landing page is the only topic that should be added to the TOC. The landing page should contain the following items:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">BugBase Product Area:&#160;</span>Most test plans will be associated with a specific area in the BugBase.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Description:&#160;</span>A brief description of the module and what should be covered when testing this module. Because some modules have cross-over functionality, the description should also include what will not be covered in the test plan. For example, when testing Concepts, you are not expected to test Search Filters. Search Filters are covered in their own test plan.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Dependencies:&#160;</span>Identify any dependencies or prerequisite configurations needed to perform the test plan. For example, </li>
            <li><span class="bold">Test Plan List:&#160;</span>List each individual topic test plan that must be completed to fully test the module. As best as possible, try to list test plans in a logical order. Use Cross-References here in case test plans are renamed in the future.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Testing Resources:&#160;</span>Provide links to any testing resources that might exist that will assist in completing the module. For the most part, testing resources should be saved here:&#160;<a href="file://fs1/QA/Test Projects/Test Plan Projects/">\\fs1\QA\Test Projects\Test Plan Projects</a></li>
            <li><span class="bold">Notes:&#160;</span>Provide any notes or comments that would be helpful to know prior to performing the test plan. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Test Plan Topic Organization</h4>
        <p>All Test Plan Topics should be contained in the \Content\QA\TestPlans\ folder. Within that folder are subfolders for each product. Within the product subfolders are subfolders for the module groups that exist in each products full module list. And within those group folders are subfolders for each module. For example, the test plans for testing Tables in Flare should be in \Content\QA\TestPlans\Flare\Editing\Tables.</p>
        <h3>Images</h3>
        <h4>Test Plan Image Organization</h4>
        <p>All Test Plan Images should be contained in the \Content\Resources\Image\TestPlans\ folder. Within that folder are subfolders for each product as well as some special folders. Within the product subfolders are subfolders for the module groups that exist in each products full module list. And within those group folders are subfolders for each module. For example, the test plans for testing Tables in Flare should be in \Content\QA\TestPlans\Flare\Editing\Tables.</p>
