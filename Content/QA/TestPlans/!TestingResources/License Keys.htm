        <h3>Explanation of product license keys</h3>
        <p>License keys for all MadCap products are designed to work for one product only. The product to which a license key belongs is easily determined by observing the first two characters in the key.

        <h3>Explanation of evaluation keys</h3>
        <p>Evaluation keys (or "training keys") are generally given to customers who have not purchased a product, but need a key to bypass the trial limitations. They can also be given to customers for the purpose of training. Essentially, they allow a customer to use the products as if they had a regular license key. However, all evaluation keys expire after so many days.</p>
        <p>To acquire an Evaluation Key, contact <a href="mailto:fnovak@madcapsoftware.com?subject=Evaluation Key Request">Frank</a>. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Evaluation Key</p>
        <p>XX - Used for Trails and Training.  These expire after so many days, and a product using an Evaluation Key should prompt each time it is launched indicating the number of days remaining.</p>
