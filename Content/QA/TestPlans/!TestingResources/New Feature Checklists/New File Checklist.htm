        <h1>Flare Project:&#160;New File Checklist</h1>
        <p>Whenever Flare adds support for a new file type, verify that the new file type passes every item in this checklist.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul class="checkbox">
            <li>Add File dialog<ul class="checkbox"><li>First, use CTRL-T to open the Add File dialog and verify the new file type appears in the file type drop-down</li><li>In the Add File dialog, if you choose New From Existing and click the browse button, the Open File dialog offers the new file type's correct file extension(s).</li><li>Bottom section of Add File dialog updates to display new file type's name</li><li>If this is a Project file (not a Content file), the file is added to the appropriate Project folder (most new files will go in the Advanced folder; new import files in Imports)</li></ul></li>
            <li>Add File Menus (if necessary; not necessary if new file type is a new type of a file we already support, ie image or multimedia file type)<ul class="checkbox"><li>New file type is added to !Project |&#160;New (Ribbon interface) </li><li>New file type is added to !Project menu (Toolstrip interface)</li><li>Content files:&#160;New file type is added to Content Explorer right-click menu:&#160;!New |&#160;[File Type]</li><li>Project files:&#160;New file type is added to Project Organizer, Project folder right-click menu: !Add |&#160;[File Type]</li><li>Project files:&#160;New file type is added to Project Organizer subfolder right-click menu (most new files will go in Advanced): Add [File Type]</li></ul></li>
            <li>Templates<ul class="checkbox"><li>&#160;In most cases, we must provide a template. (The only reason we would NOT provide a template would be if the new file type falls into an existing category such as images or multimedia)  If we do, verify new files can be added to a Flare project when Flare is run in all localized UI&#160;languages.<ul class="checkbox"><li>English</li><li>German</li><li>French</li><li>Japanese</li></ul></li><li>Verify that the new file type can be saved as a template (!File |&#160;Save as Template)</li><li>Verify that the new file type can be added to an existing template folder via the Template Manager.

            <li>Condition Tag can be applied to the file<ul class="checkbox"><li>If the file is a MadCap proprietary file (fltar, flglo, etc), we should be able to write the condition to the file</li><li>If the file is not a MadCap proprietary file (css, htm, png, swv, etc), we may or may not be able to write the condition to the file. In cases like image or multimedia files, we must write the condition to a props file.</li></ul></li>
            <li>File Tag can be applied to the file<ul class="checkbox"><li>If the file is a MadCap proprietary file (fltar, flglo, etc), we should be able to write the File Tag to the file</li><li>If the file is not a MadCap proprietary file (css, htm, png, swv, etc), we may or may not be able to write the File Tag to the file.
